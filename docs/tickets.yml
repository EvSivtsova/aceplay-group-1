  - title: Fix security issue with entities being used as `@RequestBody` fields
    description: |
      SonarLint highlights an issue with this project's approach to accepting
      data from the user. For example, in `PlaylistsController`'s `create`
      method.

      ```java
        public Playlist create(@RequestBody Playlist playlist) {
      ```

      [See SonarLint docs for further
      details.](https://rules.sonarsource.com/java/tag/spring/RSPEC-4684)

  - title: Order playlists by last track added
    description: |
      When you add a track to a playlist, it currently adds it in some odd place
      in the playlist.

      Amend the application so that the next playlist appears at the bottom.

  - title: Assign tracks and playlists to the signed in user
    description: |
      Currently, no matter who you log in as you can see everyone's playlists
      and tracks.

      Amend the application so that the user only sees their own playlists and
      tracks.

  - title: Prohibit empty playlist names
    description: |
      Currently, you can add a playlist with an empty name and it shows up as
      a strange tiny box.

      Amend the application so that playlists with empty names are not created.

  - title: Prohibit empty track title & artist
    description: |
      Currently, you can add a track with an empty title or artist and it shows
      up as blank.

      Amend the application so that tracks with empty fields are not created.

  - title: Implement deleting tracks from playlist
    description: |
      The client expects to send requests as follows:

      ```
      DELETE /api/playlists/:playlist_id/tracks/:track_id
      # Expected response if the track is successfully removed:
      # Status code: 200 (OK)
      # But with no content
      ```

      And have the track removed from the playlist.

  - title: Implement deleting playlists
    description: |
      Right now the user can't delete playlists.

      Implement the functionality to do so and comment here documenting the
      endpoint you have created. This information will be handed to the
      front-end team who will implement based on your description.
